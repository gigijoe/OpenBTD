An STM32F10x devices compiler toolchain based off of Mike Szczys's format and Devthrash's 'STM32F1-workarea'.

My aim was to allow the user to compile a lib and link to that instead of manually adding the desired .c files. Not a whole lot of value added, but
w/e. Feel free to use it if you wish, suggest recommendations if you feel the urge.

If you find this useful, should you ever run into me and are capable of doing so, please treat this poor soul to a beer. :)

Cheers.
